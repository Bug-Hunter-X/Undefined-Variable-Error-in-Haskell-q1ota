# Undefined Variable Bug in Haskell

This repository demonstrates a common error in Haskell programming: using an undefined variable. The `bug.hs` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.hs` provides a corrected version.

The bug arises from attempting to perform an operation on a variable (`x`) that has not been assigned a value. This results in a runtime exception.  The solution involves assigning a value to the variable before use.
